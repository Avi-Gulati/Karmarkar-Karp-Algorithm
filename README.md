In this project, my friend Eric and I implemented a number of heuristics to solve the number partition problem. Using the Karmarkar-Karp algorithm, we experimented with three algorithms that vary in performance based on set size and prepartitioning. 
1. Repeated random: repeatedly generate random solutions to the problem, as determined by the
representation
2. Hill climbing: generate a random solution to the problem, and then attempt to improve it through
moves to better neighbors
3. Simulated annealing: generate a random solution to the problem, and then attempt to improve it
through moves to neighbors, that are not always better
